    <p>Hi! I'm Rene, I'm fifteen and I am learning how to make my own website! I love to read and draw. I hate tomatoes and love strawberries. A fun fact about me is that I was adopted when I was six. I made this really cool side scroller game with one of my friends <a href="https://https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/166892653//"> </p>
