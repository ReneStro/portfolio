<p>Hi! I'm Rene, I'm sixteen and my favorite color is black. I like Kelly Clarkson's music and I write some music myself. I'm homeschooled. I love drawing and I really like helping other people out. I go to Church with my family and I was baptized when I was eleven. I have a lot of friends, and most of them are girls (go figure). I want to have a job in Computer programming and I have taken several classes and gone to special events for girls my age such as: <br /> <br />Participating in a Girls who Code Club  <br> <br> Taking part in a seven week programming course at IBM through Girls Who Code <br> <br> Going to a programming event at Yammer through Black Girls Code <br> <br> And taking many, many, extensive classes online.
  <br /><br /> As for my family, there's five of us (not counting the cat). I have two brothers (one older, one younger). My younger brother and I were adopted when I was around six and he was four.
